# go-jailconf
FreeBSD jail.conf file reader/writer in Go

go-jailconf is essentially a Go version of [py-jailconf](https://github.com/leforestier/jailconf). I wrote it as a weekend project – it was my first time using Go. Despite its shameful origins (Google), I found Go to be a useful language, although static typing is clearly a double-edged sword when it comes to high level programming. I am yet to explore how useful Go is for other tasks but for writing this reader/writer of FreeBSD’s jail.conf file, I must say it was a rather pleasant experience. The code is now GPLed on Github. Enjoy and let me know if you find it useful!
